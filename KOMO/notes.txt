Installing KOMO on my Ubuntu machine
====================================

The simple way did not work as some required libraries were missing on my machine.
So I used the script file in the install folder to get all the necessary components. 
This worked but after that I was still not able to compile the code.
The problem is that the linker is not able to find the libCore.so library. Don't know how to get access to this stuff. Googling 
did not help so far...

Update: 

Marc Toussaint responded my E-Mail.
Added parameter setting 'GRAPHVIZ = 0' to govMake/config.mk file - now compilation works.


Implementation:

Use one KinematicWorld that is used to display all the calculated trajectories, to avoid to pollute the screen with a lot of windows.
For each planning request, the KinematicWorld has to be reloaded and target link has to be translated and rotated.
But how to insert additional collision objects???
