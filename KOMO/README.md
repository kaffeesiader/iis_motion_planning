# The KOMO slice of the MLR code base

This code is a slice of the full MLR code base, containing
optimization methods. This is also the reason for the unusual
directory layout.


## Installation

Generically, the following should work:

cd share
make
cd examples/KOMO/easy
make
./x.exe

On problems, maybe you have to install some more Ubuntu
packages or adapt to other OS. Please refer to the files

* README.mlr.md
* install/INSTALL_ALL_UBUNTU_PACKAGES.sh

These two refer to the whole MLR code base. You
probably need to install only a fraction of these packages.
