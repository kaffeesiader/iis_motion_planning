Robot description
=================

This folder contains the ORS description of IIS Lab robot setup.
Description files of arms and hands, along with the required meshes are located in the 'iis_robot' subfolder.
Static objects like the table and the robot torso are described within 'env.ors'.
The file 'iis_robot.kvg' brings all parts together.

The following statement can be used to view the model (needs to be executed from within this folder!!!):
	
	./ors_edit iis_robot.kvg

This brings up an OpenGL window, displaying the model. Hitting the ENTER key within this window reloads
the model and can therefore be used to quickly visualize modifications on those description files.
