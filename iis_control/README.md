IISControl
==========

This package provides all the necessary infrastructure to execute time-parameterized trajectories. It is based on the ros_control stack, that is part of the ROS hydro distribution. The implementation and functionality of this node is explained in detail within my [bachelor thesis](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ehevlv3nxj7h5hb/thesis.pdf?dl=0) in the section about the 'hardware adapter node'. I only changed the name from `uibk_moveit_adapter` to `iis_control`.
