Test gripper action clients
===========================

There is a small test programm that can be used to test if the gripper action clients are working.
This test can be used for the simulator and the real robot as well, but it has to be launched in the correct namespace
('simulation' or 'real').

Namespace switching is done on the console by setting the 'ROS_NAMESPACE' environment variable.

  To switch to the required namespace you can use

    export ROS_NAMESPACE=simulation
  or
    export ROS_NAMESPACE=real
  
After that, you can run the test for each gripper seperately, by typing

  rosrun uibk_moveit_adapter test_gripper_action left
or
  rosrun uibk_moveit_adapter test_gripper_action right
